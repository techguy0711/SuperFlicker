**SuperFlicker**

SuperFlicker is a sample app using the Flicker public API's. The app is written with SwiftUI, and Combine. the archetecture is inspired by the clean archetecture. I completed in roughly 3 hours with minimal help from the web.

Given the time constraints the test coverage is 23%. Given more time I could bring it up to 80% by writing UI tests and also Unit testing the network layer.
